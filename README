Repositories are created in
  /data/nightly/svn
using
  svn co <url> <path> --ignore-externals

Externals can be included by including a .externals file in the root directory of the svn checkout, which should have one directory per line. These will be included using
  svn update <directory> --ignore-externals
so it will *not* fetch externals recursively. Any 'recursive' externals should be included with their full path from the *original* svn root checkout.

<path> uses . as a separator for subpackages: pywikipedia.spelling is a subpackage of pywikipedia. This currently works for only one level. (this actually has not been coded yet)

The packages are generated nightly using a crontab entry:
# m h  dom mon dow   command
  0 20 *   *   *     /bin/bash $HOME/src/nightly/nightly.sh


The current repositories are:
pywikipedia	 http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/pywikipedia/trunk/pywikipedia
pywikipedia.spelling	http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/pywikipedia/trunk/spelling
pywikipedia-rewrite	 http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/pywikipedia/branches/rewrite
