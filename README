Welcome to the Pywikipedia project on the Wikimedia Toolserver.

This multi-maintainer project has been set-up to keep pywikipedia nightlies available to the public.

Housekeeping notes:
  * Keep all human-created files under <project>/src/
  * Keep all human-created files under source control (git, for nightly)
  * Keep all generated files under data/<project>
    - this includes, but is not limited to, svn checkouts and packaged nightlies

  * Please save instructions on how to initialize and configure in a README file
    per <project> folder
  
  * Use symlinks to create the public_html structure

An automated testing system was added to run after creating the nightly.
This testing system uses a python virtualenv to install the nose testing framework, located in
$HOME/src/nightly/tests.

Note: the crontab runs on willow, not on nightshade! (and using crontab, not cronie)
